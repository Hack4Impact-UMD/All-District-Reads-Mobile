### PR Notes
For the PR descriptions, we encourage writing out a complete summary of the tasks finished within that PR and a list of 
methods you tested the code with. The testing can be just one line just to inform the reviewer. Because this is a mobile app,
there are multiple methods of testing, which is why we ask you to list methods of testing.

If your PR is not reviewed within 24 hours, please let the tech leads know through a message on Slack.

### App Functionality
The mobile app provides parents with these functions:
- Can fill out surveys
- Can add data such as - name, email, school system, # of kids in the school system, specific school within the district)
- Can view reading assignments/schedule
- Can view trivia questions corresponding to the reading assignment that they are expected to ask their kid(s)
- Can fill out an explicit acknowledgment that they did the reading
- Push Notifications: Reminders to do reading, complete the survey if not done, and donate to ADR

## Getting Started with the ADR Mobile App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
